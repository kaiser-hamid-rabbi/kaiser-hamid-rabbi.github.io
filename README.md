Hello, Universe! This is Kaiser Hamid Rabbi, Software Engineer, ML @TigerIT focuses on Biometric Research and end-to-end credential management
solutions. I am generally positively charged and always try to learn my lessons the hard way. I
would characterize myself as both a Computer Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer and
in the past, I‚Äôve tried many things before finding my way, before finding my passions. I‚Äôm an
Autodidact. So, I learned a lot by myself. I self-teach a lot. I am always curious about - what I
don't know? (LYGOMETRY) and always push myself to the limit. Mathematics, Theoretical
Physics, and Astronomy are three of my subjects of interest. Last but not least, Programming is
very near and dear to my heart!

I also call myself an eclectic reader. I am not an academic researcher but a synthesizer of
information from different resources. I assimilate my ideas and information based on my own
experience. I spend most of my time reading computer science books, research papers, technical
blog posts, listening to educational podcasts, watching numerous lectures online on subjects of
my interest, and reading self-help books to reshape myself as a highly effective and better
human being.
